  TutorialTexts:
  - "Align the acolyte\u2019s color with that of the conjuring point in correct ORDER.
    Only way to get the correct order is by trial and error. Summoning circle will
    indicate if the sacrifice was correct. "
  - For each level there is X number of acolyte of given color going to be spawned.
    Once there is no way you can win (all expected acolytes are dead), you lose.
  - A mere drag of your finger shall guide the acolyte. Should you neglect him, he
    will wander off and his faith is sealed.
  - If the acolyte wander toward the middle or toward wrong conjuring point a lost
    soul shall emerge instead.
  - "Yet, fear not! For should the acolyte and lost soul cross paths, the lost soul
    shall miraculously mirror the acolyte\u2019s very color."
  - The "1" and "2" keys hold within them mystical power-ups if charged up. Acolyte
    can collect them. Only one can be collected for each type at the same time.
  - "If by some misfortune the game is not centered or you can\u2019t see anything,
    use WSAD or mouse scroll to adjust it."
  - You can read the tutorial again by pressing "T"
